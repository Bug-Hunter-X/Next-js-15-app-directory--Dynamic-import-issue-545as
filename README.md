# Next.js 15 App Directory Dynamic Import Issue

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior encountered when using dynamic imports within a component in the Next.js 15 app directory.  The issue involves a situation where a dynamic import, seemingly correctly implemented, fails to function as expected.  This leads to runtime errors or unexpected component rendering.

## Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the unexpected behavior (described in detail in the `bug.js` file).

## Solution

A potential solution is shown in `bugSolution.js` which addresses the dynamic import issues found in the original code. The solution might involve adjusting the import strategy or using a different approach to handle dynamic imports within the app directory.  Please refer to the `bugSolution.js` file for more details on the implemented solution.

## Additional Notes

The unexpected behavior could be linked to how Next.js 15 handles dynamic imports within the app directory.   Further investigation is required to determine the root cause and to explore other possible solutions and workarounds.  The provided solution may not be exhaustive, and alternative solutions might exist.
